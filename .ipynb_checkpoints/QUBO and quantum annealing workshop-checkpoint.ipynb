    "Welcome to our workshop on \"QUBO and quantum annealing\"! In this workshop, we will explore the fascinating world of quantum computing and its potential applications in solving complex optimization problems using the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. We will also delve into the concept of quantum annealing, a computational approach that takes advantage of the quantum nature of particles to efficiently search for the optimal solution of a given problem. Through interactive discussions and hands-on activities, we aim to provide participants with a fundamental understanding of QUBO and quantum annealing and its practical implications in various fields such as logistics, finance, and healthcare. Whether you are a quantum computing enthusiast or simply curious about this cutting-edge technology, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey!"
